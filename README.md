Valid feelings bot

This repository is provided solely for viewing the inner workings of the bot.

Based off of an old now-dead project called WeFeelFine. It scraped from blogging sites for "I feel..." or "I am feeling..." sentences.
It apparently had demographics associated with the frequencies of emotions.
The motivation here, however, was the idea of a list of Valid Emotions and the colors that were associated with them (somehow)

Running the script tweets a tweet with a message with the feeling, and an image that has the feeling and hex value of the color,
on a background of the color. 

As it's now (has been for several months) on my Pi, it's set up on cron.
